# HexViewer
A program that prints and modifies binary files
The program reads from the console a path to a binary file, then the program allows the user to:
 - view bytes in hexadecimal numbers
 - view bytes as symbols, if a byte is a latin letter, to print it, otherwise - print "."
 - change byte by index
 - remove last byte
 - save changes in the same file
 - save changes in another file
